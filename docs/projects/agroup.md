# üå± Agroup ‚Äì Smart Agriculture Platform

## üìñ Overview
A platform focused on the **digitalization of agricultural monitoring** through IoT sensors that transmit environmental and geospatial data in real time.  
The system enables the management of crops, users, and automated alerts, while providing **dynamic and intuitive dashboards** for data visualization.  

I started as a **co-founder** and later took on the role of **lead developer**, responsible for the system‚Äôs technical architecture, cloud infrastructure, and performance optimization strategy.

## üë§ Role and Responsibilities
- **Main Role:** Co-founder & Lead Developer  
- **Key Contributions:**
  - Led technical decisions and architectural strategy.  
  - Designed, developed, and deployed backend and frontend components.  
  - Configured and managed the entire AWS-based infrastructure.  
  - Provided mentorship and code reviews for interns and junior developers.

## üöÄ Core Features
- Real-time data ingestion, storage, and visualization from IoT sensors.  
- Full administration of sensors, users, crops, and simulation processes.  
- Automated email alerts and notifications.  
- GPS coordinate tracking alongside environmental metrics.  
- Scheduled background tasks for periodic calculations (every 30 minutes).

## üèÜ Technical Achievements
- ‚ö° **Performance Optimization:** Reduced sensor write time from ~3 s to **300‚Äì400 ms** (‚àí85%).  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Efficient Infrastructure:** Implemented SSL certificates and deployed on a **small single instance without a load balancer**, achieving **~15% monthly cost savings**.  
- üß© **Data Migration:** Redesigned the relational data model and migrated 70% of the backend from DynamoDB (NoSQL) to RDS, improving data consistency and scalability.  
- üîî **Asynchronous Automation:** Integrated background alerts and recurring tasks without blocking main execution flows.  
- üß± **Frontend Modernization:** Upgraded React from v16 to v19, ensuring compatibility and optimized bundling.  
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Technical Leadership:** Coordinated development efforts, mentored team members, and performed strategic architectural reviews.

```

### 2. Crop Management

- Record plots, geographic location, and crop type.
- Calculate custom indicators (e.g., average humidity per crop).

### 3. Smart Alerts

- Configure alert thresholds by variable and crop.
- Automatic email notifications.
