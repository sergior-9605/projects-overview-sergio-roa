# üíº Luciana ‚Äì Human Resources Management Platform

## üìñ Overview and Context
Luciana was a **comprehensive HR and recruitment platform** with **multi-user access (B2C and B2B)**. It was used by internal teams (recruitment, medical, accounting, support) and **external users** (candidates and partner companies).  
The system centralized employee data, automated hiring processes, and generated documents, reports, and notifications.

My role was as a **Full-stack Developer**, actively contributing to maintenance, new feature development, and technical decision-making.  
I also took on **informal technical coordination**, supporting other developers, conducting code reviews, and resolving critical incidents.

## üèÜ Technical Achievements and Challenges

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Refactored inefficient logic from *ApiHandler* to optimized ORM queries using Laravel.  
  ‚Üí **Result:** Response times reduced from **15 s to 2‚Äì3 s**, payload size reduced from **10 MB to 1.2 MB**.  
  ‚Üí **Impact:** Improved server stability and enabled uninterrupted remote work.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Hybrid Storage Architecture
- Designed and implemented a hybrid storage system (local instance + Google Cloud Storage), migrating **1 TB of files** without data loss.  
  ‚Üí **Impact:** **15‚Äì20 % reduction in infrastructure costs** and improved scalability and security.

### üß± Frontend Migration (Angular v2 ‚Üí v19)
- Planned and initiated the full frontend rewrite, establishing the core architecture and successfully migrating several key modules.  
  ‚Üí Demonstrated the project‚Äôs feasibility and immediate benefits in performance and developer experience.  

[‚û°Ô∏è **See technical details of the migration project here**](./luciana-front.md)

**Note:** The full migration was later paused due to a company reprioritization, but the initial phase I led provided a strong proof of concept and technical foundation for future modernization.

### üí° Backend Migration (Lumen 5.4 ‚Üí 11)
- Developed a proof of concept to validate backend migration ensuring full compatibility with Angular 19.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Modules and Automations

### 1. Onboarding and Document Management (B2C)
- Designed the candidate self-service portal, from registration to document submission.  
- Implemented automatic document reuse across processes, eliminating redundancy.  
- Created **data and document transfer logic** between operations, increasing team efficiency by **25 %**.

#### üîÑ Onboarding Flow

```


### 2. Efficiency and Bulk Processing
- **Excel Batch Upload:** Automated registration of thousands of candidates in bulk.  
- **Mass Document Generation:** Simultaneous PDF downloads filtered by company, position, or document type.

### 3. Occupational Health and Compliance
- **Sick Leave Module:** Dynamic form system with validation and automated notifications.  
- **Medical Exam Module:** Budgeting, scheduling, automatic templates, and multichannel notifications.  
- **Critical Medical Cases:** Full traceability of workplace health and safety incidents (HSE).

#### ü©∫ Disabilities Module Flow

    D --> F{Approval}
    F -->|Yes| G[Notification of approval and payment to the employee]
    F -->|No| H[Notification of rejection to the employee]
  end

```

### 4. Internal Control and Auditing
- **Dynamic Reports:** Replaced weekly BI reports with real-time dashboards.  
- **Internal Ticketing Systems:** Implemented two management systems ‚Äî one for development requests (bugs, features) and one for IT support (printers, passwords), improving team workflow.  
- **Asset Inventory Module:** Designed a system to manage company equipment (serials, user history, dates), optimizing purchasing planning.

## üìà Quantifiable Impact
- **Cost Reduction:** Eliminated the need for external medical management providers.  
- **Time Savings:** Decreased operational workload by **20‚Äì50 %** in key tasks.  
- **Operational Stability:** Removed server overload issues.  
- **Financial Control:** Automated tracking of medical lab costs.
