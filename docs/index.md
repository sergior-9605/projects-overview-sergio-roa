## 🌟 Key Achievements: Critical Systems and Automation

### 1. 🚀 Performance Optimization and Operational Capacity

* **Performance Transformation (KPI):** I optimized crucial *queries* in Laravel (migrating from *API Handler* to ORM), **reducing result size from 10 MB to 1.2 MB** and **response time from 15 seconds to 2-3 seconds**.
    * **Impact:** This optimization resolved server saturation (physical), **enabling remote work** for staff and **unlocking capacity** for the development of new critical modules.
* **Cost Savings and Cloud Migration (15-20%):** I designed and implemented a **hybrid storage system (Local + GCS/GCP)**, migrating **1 TB of data** without loss. This generated a **15-20% cost savings** by reducing instance disk space.

* **Leadership in Critical Backend Migration:** I executed the **migration of 70% of the backend** (developed with Java/Spring Boot) from a poorly structured **DynamoDB**-based system to a robust relational solution (**RDS**). This refactoring ensured **data integrity, querying, and scalability**.

### 2. ✅ Leadership in Hiring Automation (Quantified Savings)

* **Hiring Acceleration and Self-Service Portal:** I implemented a **high-volume Candidate Portal** that centralized data and document uploads. This eliminated a critical bottleneck and resulted in a **20% reduction in processing time** for Psychology and HR.
* **Automatic Integration and Efficiency (30% Savings):** I created the integration for automatic transfer of **data, documents, and procedure results** between different systems used by the company. This **reduced manual processing by 30%**, allowing teams in some cases to **start with 25% of work already completed** in each hiring process.
* **Mass Synchronization Script and Compliance:** I developed a script that processed a Payroll Excel to identify and **automatically create thousands of missing contract records** in the system (requisition, operation, contract). This resolved a **critical integrity and compliance issue** by ensuring all information and documentation existed on the platform.


### 3. 🛡️ Risk Mitigation and Internal Control

* **Vendor Replacement and Mass Usage (Sick Leave Module)**: I led the development of the **Sick Leave** module, replacing an expensive third-party application. This module is used by **thousands of people** (via login and public URL) and includes automatic notifications (WhatsApp), generating **direct savings** and a **substantial improvement in management**.

* **Replacement and Automation of Medical Exams:** I led the development of a medical exam referral module that **replaced a third-party platform** that was failing. The automation of orders, emails, and **WhatsApp notifications** resulted in a **50% time savings** for the medical process manager and provided **financial control** to Accounting.


* **Legal Risk Mitigation (Medical Cases):** I developed the **Medical Cases** module, centralizing documentation and tracking (HSE). This **mitigated lawsuit risks** that the company faced due to lost documentation and lack of legal follow-up.


* **Real-Time Auditing and Management:** I created **critical reports** (in real-time) for hiring tracking. These reports overcame the slowness of the existing BI and incorporated **complex business logic** for internal auditing.
* **Extreme Frontend Modernization:** I executed the complete update of React (v2020 to v19) and Angular, the partial update (v2 to v19), ensuring maintainability, performance, and compliance with best practices.
